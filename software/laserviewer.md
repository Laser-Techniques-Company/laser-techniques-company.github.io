# LaserViewer&trade; Inspection Software

The LP-5000&trade; is provided with our proprietary LaserViewer&trade; data acquisition and reporting software, which is a commercially produced, standard product employing a Windowsïƒ”-based platform. It is capable of acquiring and mapping multichannel laser profilometry data, as well as LaserVideo&trade; imaging (LVI), laser-scanned FPI and straightness data. The LVI provides an image of the component surface similar to that of a borescope. The LVI, however, is unaffected by the optical distortion that is typical for borescopes. It is a quantitative map of the surface reflectance that allows operators to locate and measure features such as chips, scratches and discoloration.

## Customizable Operator Interface

A powerful aspect of the LaserViewer&trade; software package is its ability to be configured for customer-specific applications. In this manner, only functions and views that are specifically required for a given task are displayed to the operator. The graphic user interface can be configured for simplicity of operation and application-specific functionality. In addition, a variety of custom data analysis and reporting modules are available with the LaserViewer&trade; software program.

## Motion Control

LaserViewer&trade; provides a user-friendly and flexible motion control interface that allows a variety of operator-configurable motion control options including continuous helical and step/increment operation.
