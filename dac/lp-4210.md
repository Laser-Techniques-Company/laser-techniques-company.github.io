# LP-4210F&trade; DAC Instrument

The LP-4210F&trade; integrates the capabilities of a portable computer, a laser sensor controller and a motion control unit into one multifunction instrument that is capable of supporting a wide variety of applications.

The LP-4210F&trade; provides operators the ability to control:

- laser sensor operation,
- electronic signal processing,
- sensor motion control, and
- data acquisition, storage, analysis and reporting.

The instrument has a bright, built-in flatscreen monitor and is provided with mouse/keyboard interface. Additional features include laser power control for sensors in both Constant Power (three fixed settings) and Automatic Power Control modes.

The LP-4210F&trade; also includes our unique SmartLaser&trade; function, a laser safety control feature that causes the laser to pulse at very low average power when a sensor is not within measuring range of a test part. This low-power pulsing mode limits the average laser power emitted from the inspection head to meet normal laser safety guidelines.
The LP-4210F&trade; allows operators to adjust the signal amplification gain and provides error indicators for monitoring the quality of data during operation.

## Rugged, Shock mounted Enclosure

The LP-4210F&trade; was built specifically for harsh industrial and military applications.
All internal components are shock-mounted and designed to operate under a wide variety of environmental conditions. Rugged end covers provide protection for the front and back panels during local storage and shipment
